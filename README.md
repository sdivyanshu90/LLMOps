# 🌟 LLMOps

Welcome to my repo! 🎉
This is where I’ve collected practice code from the **LLMOps course** offered by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **Google Cloud**.

The course gave me hands-on experience with how to work with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in a practical, safe, and scalable way.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🗂️ Data Preparation

* How to clean and structure datasets for LLMs.
* Why high-quality data matters so much for good results.

### ⚙️ Automation & Orchestration with Pipelines

* Building ML pipelines to automate repetitive steps.
* Orchestrating workflows so things run smoothly at scale.

### 📊 Predictions

* Deploying LLMs to serve predictions in real-world settings.
* Measuring, monitoring, and improving model outputs.

### 💡 Prompts

* Writing effective prompts to guide LLMs.
* Experimenting with prompt engineering techniques.

### 🔒 Safety

* Understanding risks with LLMs (bias, misuse, etc.).
* Adding guardrails for safer and more responsible AI.
